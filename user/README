This directory contains the source code for all user-level processes,
split out by main function.

Naming convention:

    idle()      classic 'idle' process; ensures there is always a
                runnable process to dispatch (vs., for instance, having
                dispatch() pause when there is nothing to dispatch).

    init()      classic 'init' process; starts the idle process, and
                starts (and restarts) the user shell program.

    shell()     "user shell" process, for spawning individual tests

    progN()     program source code for user process(es) 'N'

All of these expect at least one command-line argument.  All are invoked
with command lines of this form:

    name  x  n

Each of these is designed to be compiled and linked separately, with the
resulting load modules bundled into a blob for automatic loading by the
bootstrap. Each will typically use one or more library functions from the
../lib directory.
