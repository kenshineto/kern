** To simplify declaring them, we define a macro that expands into

** User process controls.

** To enable a specific test, define the symbol SPAWN_name here, and
** guard the places in other code that use or refer to that test. For
** example, test 'A' is enabled by definining SPAWN_A here, and all
** places that refer to test 'A' are guarded with:
**
**      #ifdef SPAWN_A
**          ... conditionally-compiled code
**      #endif

** Generally, most of these will exit with a status of 0.  If a process
** returns from its main function when it shouldn't (e.g., if it had
** called exit() but continued to run), it will usually return a status
** of ?.
