** Delay values
**
** Notes:  The parameter to the delay() function is ambiguous; it
** purports to indicate a delay length, but that isn't really tied
** to any real-world time measurement.
**
** On the original systems we used (dual 500MHz Intel P3 CPUs), each
** "unit" was approximately one tenth of a second, so delay(10) would
** delay for about one second.
**
** On the current machines (Intel Core i5-7500), delay(100) is about
** 2.5 seconds, so each "unit" is roughly 0.025 seconds.
**
** Ultimately, just remember that THESE VALUES ARE APPROXIMATE AT BEST.
