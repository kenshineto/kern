**
** Based on:    c_io.c 1.13 (Ken Reek, Jon Coles, Warren R. Carithers)
**
** Declarations and descriptions of console I/O routines
**
**  These routines provide a rudimentary capability for printing to
**  the screen and reading from the keyboard.
**
** Screen output:
**  There are two families of functions.  The first provides a window
**  that behaves in the usual manner: writes extending beyond the right
**  edge of the window wrap around to the next line, the top line
**  scrolls off the window to make room for new lines at the bottom.
**  However, you may choose what part of the screen contains this
**  scrolling window.  This allows you to print some text at fixed
**  locations on the screen while the rest of the screen scrolls.
**
**  The second family allows for printing at fixed locations on the
**  screen.  No scrolling or line wrapping are done for these functions.
**  It is not intended that these functions be used to write in the
**  scrolling area of the screen.
**
**  In both sets of functions, the (x,y) coordinates are interpreted
**  as (column,row), with the upper left corner of the screen being
**  (0,0) and the lower right corner being (79,24).
**
**  The printf provided in both sets of functions has the same
**  conversion capabilities.  Format codes are of the form:
**
**      %-0WC
**
**  where "-", "0", and "W" are all optional:
**    "-" is the left-adjust flag (default is right-adjust)
**    "0" is the zero-fill flag (default is space-fill)
**    "W" is a number specifying the minimum field width (default: 1 )
**  and "C" is the conversion type, which must be one of these:
**    "c" print a single character
**    "s" print a null-terminated string
**    "d" print an integer as a decimal value
**    "x" print an integer as a hexadecimal value
**    "o" print an integer as a octal value
**
** Keyboard input:
**  Two functions are provided: getting a single character and getting
**  a newline-terminated line.  A third function returns a count of
**  the number of characters available for immediate reading.
**  No conversions are provided (yet).
